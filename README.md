# Open-Source-Subtask-1
I am Ashutosh Balasubramaniam, and my roll number is 220108013. This repository has been made for subtask 1 of IITG coding week, open source module.
I want to contribute to open source as its an extremely useful way to collaborate on projects on a large scale, and is easily accessible to the public.
